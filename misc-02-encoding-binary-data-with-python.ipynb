    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Files with binary data, bytes that represent non-text information like images,\n",
    "can be easily corrupted when being transferred and processed to text-only systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Base64 Encoding?\n",
    "\n",
    "Base64 encoding allows us to convert ... binary or text data\n",
    "to ASCII characters.\n",
    "By encoding our data,\n",
    "we improve the chances of it being processed correctly by various systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: THIS IS NOT AN ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM, AND SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR SECURITY PURPOSES.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use Base64 Encoding?\n",
    "\n",
    "Base64 is a popular method to get binary data into ASCII characters, which is widely understood by the majority of networks and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common real-world scenario where Base64 encoding is heavily used are in mail servers. They were originally built to handle text data, but we also expect them to send images and other media with a message. In those cases, your media data would be Base64 encoded when it is being sent. It will then be Base64 decoded when it is received so an application can use it. So, for example, the image in the HTML might look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<img src=\"data:image/png;base64,aVRBOw0AKg1mL9...\">\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Base64 encoding is a popular technique to convert data in different binary formats to a string of ASCII characters. This is useful when transmitting data to networks or applications that cannot process raw binary data but would readily handle text."
